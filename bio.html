                <h3>A Bit About Me:</h3>

                <p>I had always loved computers, playing games on them, installing my own hardware even while young.
                    However, my first career I started was repairing cars and then after that I tried my hand at air
                    traffic control, both of which were great experiences.</p>

                <p>After some years of military service I decided to go back to college and study in the field of
                    information systems. This is where my passion for programming began, while information systems only
                    lightly touches on programming the two courses I took stood out to me.</p>

                <p>I completed my information systems studies at UMGC and started a Python tutorial on YouTube. I was
                    hooked, so much so that I decided I should return to class at UMGC and persue another degree in
                    software developement and security. Though I didn't stop there, from then on I've dedicated most of
                    my free time towards other online courses, tutorials, tools, programming languages, personal
                    projects and studying computer science concepts. </p>

                <p>I'd say I've shown up late to the party, but the depth and ever changing nature of the programming
                    landscape is thrilling. I hope to make the world a better place through my projects. Thanks for
                    reading!</p>
